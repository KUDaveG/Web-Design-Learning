###Here's how I like to structure my files.

This is a matter of personal taste, but there are things that work better than others. It's important to keep your files organized so you can find them quickly and refer to them easily.

	-Website
	-- index.html (additional HTML/PHP files are at the root level unless they're organized into folders).
	-- images (Drop all images in here)
	-- library (A place to store CSS files)
	-- js (Javascript goes here)
